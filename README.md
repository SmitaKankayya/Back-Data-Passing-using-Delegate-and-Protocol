# Back-Data-Passing-using-Delegate-and-Protocol
In our project, we will have two view controllers. From initial view controller on a button click we will transition to other view controller. In the other view controller we will have data to be passed onto the initial view controller. The data will be passed to the initial view controller on a button click using delegate and protocol.
